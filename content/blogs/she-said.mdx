She came quietly,
and slowly left in silence.
The promise at the end didn't bring away loneliness.

The emotions weren't wrong,
it was the time spent alone gets torturous.
She said she wouldn't mind solitude,
as long as there is something she can hold on to.

The fireworks wouldn't be perfect if they were not at night.
The memories burnt into ashes, and no one saw the end.

I am afraid she is being detroyed day by day,
even if she says she doesn't care.

The petals are too scared to fall before dark,
The leaves followed to taste the pain of thorns.

I no longer scared of the dark,
I think I am more afraid of being awake.
