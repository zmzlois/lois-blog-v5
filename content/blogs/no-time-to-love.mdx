I should've known

I'd leave alone

Just goes to show

That the blood you bleed

Is just the blood you owe

<br/>
We were a pair

But I saw you there

Too much to bear

You were my life

But life is far away from fair


<br/>
Was I stupid to love you?

Was I reckless to help?

Was it obvious to everybody else


<br/>
That I'd fallen for a lie?

You were never on my side

Fool me once, fool me twice

Are you death or paradise?

Now you'll never see me cry

There's just no time to love


<br/>
I let it burn

You're no longer my concern

Faces from my past return

Another lesson yet to learn
