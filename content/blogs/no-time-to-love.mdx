description: "Was I being reckless to love"
---

I should've known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed
Is just the blood you owe


We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life
But life is far away from fair


Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else


That I'd fallen for a lie?
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to love


I let it burn
You're no longer my concern
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
