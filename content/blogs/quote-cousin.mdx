_Some small stories I remembered from many years ago_

<u>**Rule 1: There is no free relationship in this world**</u><br/>

The first year I went to work in Shenzhen and got in contact with my cousins' friends on a welcoming party hosted for me. I was too excited and wanted to ask his friends out for lunch -- they were managing directors in big firms or successful entrepreneurs, Forbes 30 under 30 or alike. I was extremely intrigued and wanted to know how they made it.

He said:
> Sure, but remember to think about what value you have to bring to the lunch. There are no free relations exists.

> If you don't have any values you are just my little cousin new in town and my friends want to be nice to you, they won't have any long and meaningful relationship with you in the long term if you don't provide any values. Be it emotional, information, social network or economical.

> They are not your school friends. Everyone in this city is busy. Make sure their time is not wasted.

<u>**Rule 2: Trust can only be built on time from small things.**</u>

In one of the years end we were celebrating a good financial year of two funds for my cousins, fabulous auction dinner and the countless deals he closed. A lot of source weren't from individuals, but companies. I was curious to understand how he did it because I know raising funds from corporates are particularly hard.

So I asked: _How do you know these people? How did you get in touch with them?_

He said: _Mostly just warm intro, my high school friends or someone knows someone._

I asked: _How did you even able to push your friends to make this intro for you?_

He replied: _Don't be a fucked up. Be persistent, reliable, responsive and good at what you do._

I went further: _Then how did you make them trust you at the end?_

He said:
> _Of course it won't happen on the first meeting. Investors are very sentimental and emotional. At the end the most important trigger for them to invest is you and how well they know you, or trust you. So you build the trust step by step. Have a couple meetings with them. And never be late. Don't be late. If you are late for the first meeting they won't trust you. Take care of their ego. Small things. But do them again and again._

<u>**Rule 3: If money is your only motivation, you won't last long.**</u><br/>

<u>**Rule 4: You can't lead if you can't control yourself**</u>
