>The hard confession is, for the most part, I think it was sheer luck. 

From people I met online 5 years ago to help me wrote my reference letter, to having enough public speaking experiences and publications -- most of them were not planned. It was more of _'Life nudged me in this way so I took the ride'_.

### 1, Why Global Talent Visa
Let's calculate the odds between different Visa and my current state of being.

1. I don't want to be tied to a company and be able to work on my own thing.
2. The scarcity of issuing Tier 2 Visa is increasing, and the cost of hiring a non-EU citizen is increasing.
3. I want something with a potential to turn into a permanent residency. It ruled out Tier 5 Visa.
4. Both Start up visa and Innovator Visa requires you to work on the same business idea for a minimum of 60% of your time, if you want to work on other things, you need to apply for a new visa.
5. Start up Visa only lasts for 2 years, without the option to turn into a permanent residency. 
6. Each Innovator Visa lasts for 3 years, but you need to have a minimum of £50,000 investment fund. You also need to be in Innovator Visa for 5 years before you can apply for a permanent residency. Your application fees and mental overhead is doubled. If you use the same company to apply for 2 applicants, you will need £100,000 investment fund, untouched, sitting in the bank.
7. Global Talent Visa lasts for 5 years, and you can apply for a permanent residency after 3 years. You can work on anything you want, and you can work for anyone you want. Without any investment fund.
