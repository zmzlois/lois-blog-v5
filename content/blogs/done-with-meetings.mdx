### What was the problem?

I hate meetings. We all do. Not sure how people say, "Meetings are a good time to connect with your colleagues."; I certainly don't.

When I was in the consulting industry, I had a regimented structure of meetings and they negatively impacted my workflow.

For forward 4 years later, some of my clients are dilettantes. They asked us to meet for things not related to work -- it was meeting and drinking alcohol at the same time.

And there were times that meetings weren't necessary, but the communication wasn't enough to help me understand what's going on with engineering team.

Meetings should have existed to solve problems, or, at the very least, help people grow, but not bring emotional turbulence to increase the turnover rate.

Alcohol, sure. Aggressive language, sure. However, meetings are not celebration parties, nor for individual ego fulfilment. The [damages of low effective meetings](/blogs/damages-of-low-effective-meetings) are real.

__Meetings are wasting our time, and we want to change that.__

### What we found

Among all the tools we find on the market, either small start-ups helping with daily stand-ups, or fully-fledged business suite from big companies--we have yet to find a product that highly focuses on helping conduct effective meetings to reach organisational goals.

They developed segregated products that "treat meeting as a process and what's needed in this process". **Having meetings are about the results, but not the process.**

Nothing is really challenging the status quo, or the critical thinking process of meeting effectiveness.

### Rethink how meetings should be done, from the very start

In the previous post I discussed _[What makes a meeting effective](/blogs/effective-meetings)_, the first difficult part about an effective meeting is __discovering whether a problem is worth discussing__ before the meeting happens. It leads to our first question, how do we make sure meetings are necessary?

We start with building [ComCord](https://comcord.vision/?utm=loisblog), a light, simple tool to help teams find out the most important part of a meeting: _**if there is a real problem**_

Is stand up required? ComCord will ask your team members for stand up texts to replace standup meetings.

You can also set up ComCord to ask each team member questions before the meetings start.

It will help you dig deeper into "THE WHY" of a meeting and make sure the objective of a meeting aligns with participants.

Think again, slower, critically.

### Waitlist is opened now

I am extremely excited to create something challenging how people think about meetings. There will be a lot of problems, and we are still looking for answers.

We would love to see you join our journey of building the most ridiculous team collab tool ever created.
