I thought I am a lot


Until I met someone never think I am too much

I thought I am numb and disconnected

Until I met someone I can read his soul easily from afar

I thought the gate is closed and I can be a nun

Until I met someone I have to let in

Someone whose feelings I spare

Someone who, like it or not

Will want you to share

A little, and a lot

---

Someone to crowd you with love

Someone to force you to care

Someone take it slow

Someone allow both to heal each other's trust issues

Someone makes your soul tune up and listen to the world

Take turns to support each other

Someone to make you come through

Who'll always be there

As frightened as me

Of being alive

---

The dream of someone know me from my writing has always been a dream

Until him

I didn't want to go to many places

Knowing they are beautiful to visit

I believe in the first-time memory lock

The first time deserve to be with someone special

I think I found him

---

Someone not too much on anything

Someone not too short on anything

Everything is just the right amount

As easy as I have never anticipated
