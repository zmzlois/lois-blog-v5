Even knowing you are not there

I still asked in my empty room, "Are you there?"

The air can't speak for you

Habits are the scar that never recovers

The longing await only tear the soul apart

I took a lot of photos and make a second copy of them

Just to make sure you can keep one

Bought an extra sweater for you

Thinking when I am not around it keeps you warm

But how can I reserve the warmth from me when you are alone?

I don't want you alone

Swimming in the ocean of unknown

I don't want you walk alone

In the stormy days

I don't want you alone

Bearing the cruelty from the world

I don't want tears company you forever

---

Wish you can find someone better

Find someone understand you, treasure you

Wish you a happy and abundant journey next time

Because I am used to looking at your eyes

Because my last best wish is for you

To have a happy life

May fate onboard you a new journey

And running until the world ends

Don't look back

And forget I am standing alone, wishing
